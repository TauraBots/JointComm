:no_entry: ABANDONED
This project was abandoned, since the only board we had that could do multi-port communication went kaput, and furthermore we started using another library and framework.

I always wanted to say "furthermore", so thanks everyone for this opportunity.

# JointComm
Library files to communicate with the joints, with multi-threading.\\
Maybe.
